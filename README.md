## Folder Structure
- ### `dist`
    This folder contains the build files of the guided journey.
    fdslkgds
    - #### `js`
        This folder contains the javascript build files. The file that needs to be imported to the website should be `shepherd.js`. This file has the logic and the components for displaying the banners on the website.
    - #### `css`
        This folder contains the styling build files. `shepherd.css` file needs to be imported on the website, and contains the styling information compiled from the `src` folder.


- ### `src`
    This folder contains the code files that need to be changed as per the bank's requirements. Inside the `js` file, the entire application's logic exists.
    - #### `js`
        This contains the library's main functionality code.
        - ##### `components`
            This folder contains all the components of the Shepherd library. You will need to change the content of this folder only if the bank requires any visual changes to the guided journey pop-up box.
            - ###### `shepherd-button.svelte`
                This folder contains the components for the buttons that are visible at the bottom of the guided journey pop-up
              
            - ###### `shepherd-cancel-icon.svelte`
                This folder contains the component for the cancel button at the top of the guided journey pop-up.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-content.svelte`
                This component contains the entire box content visible to the user beyond the blacked-out screen. It contains the header, footer and the text part.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-elment.svelte`
                This component file manages the appearances and the interactions for each step of the tour. It handles user focus, keyboard navigation, and dynamic class updates based on step options.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-footer.svelte`
                Footer at the bottom of the guided journey pop-up that contains buttons like **_Next_**, **_Previous_**, **_Complete_**, and **_Cancel_**
              
            - ###### `shepherd-header.svelte`
                Header at the top of the guided journey container that contains the title and the close button is defined in this file.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-modal.svelte`
                This component handles creating and managing a modal overlay with a cutout (opening) to highlight specific elements on a webpage. It defines functions to position the overlay, update its dimensions, and control visibility. The overlay's position is adjusted based on the target element, considering its location within scrollable containers or iframes. Event listeners are added to manage touch interactions and animations. The SVG element defines the visible shape of the overlay, and its visibility is toggled using CSS transitions.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-progress-bar.svelte`
                A progress bar is visible between the header and the content. The logic for calculating the progress bar is as per the title of the step. If the step is 3/6, the progress bar will be `3รท6=1/2` or 50% width.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-text.svelte`
                This component gets the text from the configuration files as HTML text.
              
            - ###### `shepherd-title.svelte`
                The title is the step number that is visible on the UI. The convention to name this is `the step number / total number of steps`, so, for example, if a journey has 12 steps and the current step is 7, the title value should be `7/12`
              
        - ##### `utils`
            Utility tools for the shepherdJS. You will be least likely to change the contents of this folder, except if the **Adobe** concept needs to be changed.
          - ###### `evented.js`
              This file defines the `Evented` class that handles all kinds of events and provides a callback-like functionality for responding to those events. 
          - ###### `shepherd.js`
              This file contains information about Shepherd JS server-side or client-side rendering. For ICICI, we are using client-side rendering, and you will not need to change this file soon.
          - ###### `step.js`
              This exports the Step class for Shepherd. This file defines the action of each method of the Step class, such as attaching to a hook, creating a tooltip, scrolling action to an element, showing a step, etc. Refer file for comments to understand the code.
          - ###### `tour.js`
              This code defines a Tour class that manages a website tour, allowing users to navigate through a series of steps that guide them through a site or feature. It is built on top of an Evented class, extending its capabilities with step-by-step guidance, handling navigation, and user interactions such as cancelling or completing the tour.
        - ##### `types`
            This folder contains the types defined in the code. Just so you know, you won't need to change these types for any future use cases. 


- ### `tours`
    This folder contains the journey files for the website and the journey configuration.
  - #### `images`
      All photos/GIFs that are required for the journey are stored here.
  - #### `newRIBDAPUtilities.js`
      This folder contains the logic for implementing the guided journey on ICICI Bank Pages. Logic like pop-up open, pop-up close and light and glow after pop-up close are defined here.
  - #### `newRIBGuidedJourneys.js`
      If there are any journeys in the future that need to be implemented, they will be stored here. For now, this file is empty.
  - #### `newRIBOverlayPages.js`
      Overlay journeys for all pages are stored here in their own functions.
